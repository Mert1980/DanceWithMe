# :dancer: Dance-With-Me HYF Graduation Project

>This repository is created for **Front end Development** program of **[Hack Your Future Belgium](https://hackyourfuture.be/)** and contains example code for the *MongoDB, Express, ReactJS, Node, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap Stack **MERN Stack***
One of the main learning outcomes of this project is figuring out how to create, explore, understand, and run a web application in a real development environment then deploy to the real production environment according to the TDD approach. So even if We manage to run all of the above mentioned technologies in a couple of weeks, many times We went back and practice different HYF modules again and again. Of course, this is not the desired final product and the aim was not to deliver fully-featured web application instead our goal was to create a viable product using this technology stack in a such short time and learn work as a team. Undoubtedly this project should be improved, on the other hand, at the moment we were working on this project it was strength times, Covid-19 measurements were in place and we had to work together but as remote working. Taking into consideration this fact it was challenging journey yet very pragmatic and instructive.

You may find details following the lines about our journey. To sum up, our main challenges were setting enviroment correctly with dependencies, keeping system stable adding new component and packets, running the tests and adding new test scripts, keeping the secure connection between back and front side and of course deployment to the real environment which is in our case Heroku.
