# :dancer: Dance-With-Me HYF Graduation Project

>This repository is created for the final project of **[Hack Your Future Belgium](https://hackyourfuture.be/)** **Frontend Development Program** and build by *HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, MongoDB, Express, NodeJS and ReactJS (**MERN Stack***).
One of the main outcomes of this project is figuring out how to create, explore and run a web application in a development environment, then deploying it to the production environment in accordance with TDD approach. 

>Our main goal was not to deliver fully-featured web application, but instead to create a minimum viable product in 4 weeks. We had to work in an environment where Covid-19 measures were in place. That means, we had to work remotely, but that shouldn't hamper our development process. In order to overcome the side-effects of remote working, we set-up daily working sessions between team members and used the benefit of collaborative coding.  

So even if we manage to run all of the above mentioned technologies in a couple of weeks, many times We went back and practice different HYF modules again and again. Of course, this is not the desired final product and the aim was not to deliver fully-featured web application instead our goal was to create a viable product using this technology stack in a such short time and learn work as a team. Undoubtedly this project should be improved, on the other hand, at the moment we were working on this project it was strength times, Covid-19 measurements were in place and we had to work together but as remote working. Taking into consideration this fact it was challenging journey yet very pragmatic and instructive.

You may find details following the lines about our journey. To sum up, our main challenges were setting enviroment correctly with dependencies, keeping system stable adding new component and packets, running the tests and adding new test scripts, keeping the secure connection between back and front side and of course deployment to the real environment which is in our case Heroku.
